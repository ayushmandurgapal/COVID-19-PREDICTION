# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Prediction 

### Overview

This notebook consists of a thorough data analysis on the COVID-19 pandemic data until August 2020. A decent amount of data cleaning and restructuring was required to get the data in the right format. A lot of intuitive charts and visualizations have been made to show the trend of the rising cases, recoveries, and deaths.

A further deatailed analysis is focused more on the countries that had the maximum cases at that time, namely, China, USA, India, Italy, France, Germany, and Spain.

A times series forecast model has also been developed using polynomial regression and Support Vector Machines regression technique to predict the cases in the future.
The polynomial regressor seems to have done a better job than SVM in predicting the cases.

Further analysis can be done based on the updated data and other machine learning techniques can be used for robust forecasts based on past data.
